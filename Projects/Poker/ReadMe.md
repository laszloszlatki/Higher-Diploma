## Poker game
The computer generates two hands with five cards each, then decides wich hand is the winner according to this rules:
* High card. If no combination can be made, then a playerâ€™s hand is valued at the highest single card. If two players have the same high card, then the second highest card would break the tie.
    
* One Pair. A pair is formed when you have two of any of the same ranks.
    
* Two Pairs. When more than one player has two pairs, the player with the highest pair wins.
    
* Three of a Kind. 3 of the same ranks.
  
* Straight. A straight is a five-card hand consisting of a running sequence of cards, regardless of suit. If two players have straights, the straight of the higher card wins.

* Flush. When all five cards in a hand are of the same suit, it is a flush. If two players have a flush, the person with the highest card in that suit wins.

* Full House. When a player has three-of-a-kind and a pair in the same hand, it is called a Full House.

* Four of a Kind. If you are lucky enough to have all four of a given number, then you have a very powerful hand.

* Straight Flush. Even rarer than four of a kind, a straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards, all from the same suit.
    
* Royal Flush. The best hand of them all is this famous combination, formed by a Straight Flush that runs to the Ace, making it unbeatable. Odds of being dealt this hand can be as high as 1 in 650,000 deals.
