## Dating app specification
* Administrators enter details of eight members (5 dates free in the next fortnight, favourite colour, sex (m/f), gender preference (m/f), favourite band, favourite restaurant, favourite sport, active/inactive)

* The system then looks to match people based on their gender preference (obviously!), at least one of their free-dates matching both being active or inactive and (at least) one matching favourite;

* The matches should then be presented to the administrator, along with a count of matches;

* Think specifically about the data and methods you need to have, the classes that implies (3?), the validation of input, any static variables you may need, privacy specifiers and your use of the Java Date-Time API.
