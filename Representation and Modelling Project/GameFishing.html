<h2>Game Fishing</h2>

<div class="style">
	<p>The pursuit of salmon, trout and sea trout holds an almost venerated place in Irish culture and our waters continue to yield world class fishing for almost unique native wild game fish. Angling for salmon and trout can be experienced in many different ways. Game fishing in Ireland is probably seen as the most popular form of fishing in the country. There are fishing clubs all over the country on different stretches of rivers. Licences are very important in game fishing without one it is illegal to fish in most waters. It is around €100 for an annual licence but you also then have to pay for a day ticket on the water you are going to this can be anywhere between €20 - €50 and even more on very popular waters. This in my opinion is very expensive, having experience fishing in other countries like New Zealand for example it cost me NZ$160 for the year with no extra cost and that included exceptional angler access and signage. Game angling in the Limerick and clare area is a great location for this discipline. Famous river such as the mighty river shannon which is the longest river in Ireland this river has accounted for vast stocks of atlantic salmon and sea trout. </p>

		<li>Atlantic Salmon</li>
	<div class="para">
		<p>Salmon that reach maturity after one year at sea are called Grilse; these return to their river in summer weighing from 0.8 to 4kg. If it takes two or more years at sea to mature the salmon will return considerably earlier in the year and larger at 3 to 15kg, and because of their size they are greatly sought after by fishermen. Salmon exhibit remarkable "homing instinct" with a very high proportion able to locate their river of origin using the earth's magnetic field, the chemical smell of their river and pheromones (chemical substances released by other salmon in the river). Perfect homing precision is expected even after migrations over 3,000km to feeding grounds north of the Arctic Circle in the Norwegian Sea and at West Greenland. There is great excitement when adult salmon return to rivers as many are seen leaping acrobatically into the air and jumping over waterfalls while moving upstream. Salmon that survive fishermen, poachers and pollution may still have to scale large dams built across rivers before eventually finding refuge in lakes and deep pools. Arriving upstream on their spawning grounds among big boulders in icy headwaters the life cycle begins again, so ensuring survival of the species for another generation.</p>

<h3>Lakes and Rivers include:</h3>
<div class="style">
<p>With a limestone base the Limerick/Clare area produces nice brown trout fishing with fish averaging about 1lb. Many fish of over 2lbs are caught each year. Fishing on the Limerick/Clare river's is by licence only and there are hatches of various olives, mayflies and sedges and dry fly is very productive. All legitimate angling methods. The season runs from 15th of February to 30th of September. Best Times: April to September.There are two main angling venues on the Shannon in the immediate Limerick area i.e. at Annacotty (5 kms) from Limerick, Plassy (in Limerick City).  The Plassey stretch is on the Shannon near Limerick university. In addition there is some very good pike angling at Castleconnell.</p>

<h3>Best methods to catch these species include:</h3>
<div class="style">
<p>Local knowledge is the first requisite for success in fishing an Irish lough. Both beginners and experienced anglers are strongly advised to hire the services of a local guide for the first few days on a lough. They will know the best flies, appropriate tackle and local fishing lore. Similarly, on salmon and trout rivers, the services of a local guide will ensure that the angler gets the most out of a visit.<br>
While game fish can be caught on all legal methods (eg: worms, spinning, etc), fly fishing is the traditional practice for catching salmon and trout. Great hatches of duckfly, mayfly and sedges are the seasonal triggers for top quality trout fishing on many Irish rivers and lakes.</p>
