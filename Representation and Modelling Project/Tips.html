	<h2 id="Water"> Water</h2>
		<p>
		<cite>The rime of the ancient mariner</cite>
		“Water, water, everywhere,Nor any drop to drink.”<br><br>
		
		A day out on the water means first and foremost pack water! Don’t be like that ancient mariner!<br>
		You never know how long you’ll be out on the water. <br>
		Staying hydrated is key to enjoying your time out on your fishing boat.<br>
		</p>
		
		
	<h2 id="Sunscreen"> Sunscreen</h2>
		<p>
		Something that can turn a great day out on the water into a day you may regret is forgetting to bring along sunscreen.<br>
		Unfortunately, there are many myths about using sunscreen.<br>
		The facts are:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>A “base tan” is still harmful to your health and skin.</li>
				<li>Sunblock works right away. You don’t need to wait 20 minutes before heading outside.</li>
				<li>Unsure of how much to use? Try the amount that would fit in a shot glass.</li>
				<li>2 to 3 tablespoons is the recommended amount to use.</li>
				<li>If you plan on being outside all day cover up as well.</li>
				<li>SPF 30 or greater is recommended if you will be out for long periods of time.</li>
				<li>Creams tend to work better than liquids.</li>
				<li>If you are sensitive to sun exposure you may want to use an SPF 50.</li>
				<li>Since you will be out on the water, invest in a waterproof sunscreen.</li>
				<li>Don’t just pack sunscreen. Wear it too.</li>
				<li>Dermatologists also recommend you pack your sunglasses too.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 id="Sunglasses"> Sunglasses</h2>
		<p>
		With all that glare from the sun off the water, you’re going to need to pack sunglasses.
		They will help you keep an eye on the water.<br>
		They may even help you hunt for fish.<br>
		Either way, don’t forget them. They will protect you from harmful UV rays.<br>
		</p>
		
	<h2 id="Cooler and snacks"> Cooler and snacks</h2>
		<p>
		It’s always a good idea to bring a cooler along to store your water as well as any food or snacks you may want to bring along.<br>
		You may even need to haul along another cooler in case you get lucky and get some fish.<br>
		Don’t forget the fish!
		</p>

	<h2 id="Watertight flashlight"> Watertight flashlight</h2>
		<p>
		You will want to pack along your watertight flashlight. Don’t forget to check the batteries!
		</p>

	<h2 id="First Aid Kit"> First Aid Kit</h2>
		<p>
		Protection is key for every aspect of your day out on your pontoon boat or fishing boat. Pack along your first aid kit.<br>
		We like to check our first aid kit before heading out in our fishing boat to make sure 
		it’s well stocked with the essentials.<br>
		Safety first when it comes to a day out on the water! Don’t skip the life jackets either.<br>
		</p>

	<h2 id="Flotation Device"> Flotation Device</h2>
		<p>
		Speaking of safety, you’ll want to have plenty of flotation devices on board for your day on the boat.<br>
		Personal Flotation Devices (PFD) are required by law.<br>
		Life jackets, lifebuoys, and other flotation devices are required equipment for safe boating.<br>
		You’ll need to have a re-boarding device along as well.<br>
