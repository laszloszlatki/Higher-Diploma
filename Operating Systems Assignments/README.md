# Operating Systems Weekly Assignments

## Contents and objectives:
**week03**  * Extend the given program so that it reads a ﬁle and writes the contents somewhere else  
**week04**  * Write a more useful version of the copyFile program so that it can accept “command line arguments”  
  * Modify this program now so that it can perform a very weak type of encryption  
**week06**  * Allocate space in your program at run-time to accommodate a large array  
  * Print out date and time in a C program and time how long a program runs for  
**week08**  * Modify the “search loop” from week6, so that it now prints out the position and value of each matching element in the array  
  * Modify the program so that instead of printing out an end time/date the number of CPU seconds is printed  
**week09**  * Speed-up search by doing the array search in parallel using as many threads as the CPU(s)
