## Contents and objectives:
  * **week03** 
1. Extend the given program so that it reads a ﬁle and writes the contents somewhere else  
  * **week04**
  1. Write a more useful version of the copyFile program so that it can accept “command line arguments”  
  2. Modify this program now so that it can perform a very weak type of encryption  
  * **week06**
  1. Allocate space in your program at run-time to accommodate a large array  
  2. Print out date and time in a C program and time how long a program runs for  
  * **week08**
  1. Modify the “search loop” from week6, so that it now prints out the position and value of each matching element in the array  
  2. Modify the program so that instead of printing out an end time/date the number of CPU seconds is printed  
  * **week09**
  1. Speed-up search by doing the array search in parallel using as many threads as the CPU(s)
