# Operating Systems Weekly Assignments

## Contents and objectives:
**week3** - Extend the given program so that it reads a ﬁle and writes the contents somewhere else  
**week4** - Write a more useful version of the copyFile program so that it can accept “command line arguments”  
          - Modify this program now so that it can perform a very weak type of encryption  
**week6** - allocate space in your program at run-time to accommodate a large array  
          - print out date and time in a C program and time how long a program runs for  
**week8** - Modify the “search loop” from week6, so that it now prints out the position and value of each matching element in the array  
          - modify the program so that instead of printing out an end time/date the number of CPU seconds is printed  
**week9** - speed-up search by doing the array search in parallel using as many threads as the CPU(s)
